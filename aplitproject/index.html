        <h1 id="poetryDescription">Poetry</h1>
        <p>Harjo's poetry is ladden with vivid nature imagery, influenced by her Mvskoke Creek heritage. In many of her poems, subtle references to Mvskoke folklore make an appearance,
            adding to the rich discussion on love, trauma, growth, resistance, and spirituality. Harjo's personal experiences trickle into her writing, and her poems tend to be very open
             and raw and vulnerable. 
        </p>
        <p>
             Her writing is incredibly intentional. My favorite example of this is her poem "Becoming Seventy," in which she crafts exactly 70 stanzas with each 
             stanza steadily growing longer. Her poems typically do not fit a particular rhyme scheme or structure. However, the structure of each poem is very carefully constructed
             in cooperation with its message. In her poem titled "Insomnia and the Seven Steps to Grace," the stanzas follow an alternating pattern. One is long, the next is short, the 
             next is long again. The structure mimics the lull of a sleep-deprived mind. On the other hand, "Invisible Fish" is written all in one stanza with short, punctuated sentences,
             mostly void of description until the very last sentence. The poem itself is about the cyclical nature of the destruction and the way we change the Earth and ourselves for 
             our benefit eventually means the world leaves us and our past behind. The poem's shortness and dry descriptions of "earlier" events reinforces the fleeting, forgetable nature
             of the past. The long, descriptive sentence at the end punctuates how much has changed and how little people have noticed.
        </p>
        <p class="end"> Though Harjo's poetry is filled with references to nature, her poems mostly center around the human experience. This means that most of her poems end up exploring the 
            deep connection between humans and the nature around them. In many of the poems, the Earth functions as a sentient character whom the narrator often interacts with. 
            A particularly strong theme across her writing is the raw, unadulterated view on the Indigenous experience. Her 
            poems in and of themselves are a form of resistance and preservation of Mvskoke history. As a poet and an activist, she speaks not only for the Mvskoke Nation, but for 
            Indigenous peoples all over the country.

            In what we now call a day.<br>
            There must have been two suns, a bright moon, somehow<br>
            We had more light than now, sheen<br>

            Walked through the shimmer of the early evening.<br>
            They had become as one song.<br>

            Back, when we knew how to hear the songs of plants<br>
            And could sing back, like now<br>
            On paper, with marks like bird feet, but where are<br>
            Our ears? They have grown to fit<br>
            Around earbuds, to hear music made for cold<br>

                <div class="annotationContainer">
                    <p class="annotation" id="a1">
                        1. In many of her interviews, Harjo refers to her poems informally as "___ poem" or "___ story." This poem specifically
                        focuses on telling the tale of the Mvskoke Creek Nation's creation of the tobacco plant. It comes from her larger collection titled <i>An American Sunrise</i>
                        that explores the history of her ancestors and the stories they left behind. These lines make it very clear that Harjo intends to tell us a story. The idea of
                        time "threading" earth and sky makes me think she refers to a time when day light and moon light were the only sources of light. Yet it also does the work of making the
                        scenery feel so connected and complete. Everything is sewn together. Everything is in place.
                    </p>
                    <p class="annotation" id="a2">
                        2. Children grew up quickly. I think it's significant that while it's clear that she's saying the children grew quickly, she doesn't
                        mention maturity anywhere. As though it wasn't a consideration at that time. As though the children were never immature. While it seems like such a simple line
                        it really does the most work of showing us just how different times were then to how they are now.
                    </p>
                    <p class="annotation" id="a3">
                        3. She's using the light as a symbol for life. We were more <em>alive</em> back then. The line also seems to suggest the moon is no longer bright. Put in context of
                        the poem which actively resists the colonization for profit of the tobacco plant and the effect that's had especially on night life, it feels like a clever way to say
                        that the nights have gotten more dangerous and depressing; dimmer, shrouded in a darker darkness. I love that Harjo explains the presence of light as "falling in love
                        playing about the Earth's body." It makes that light seem all the more warm, maybe to contrast it to light we have today which just exists.
                    </p>
                    <p class="annotation" id="a4">
                        4. And then she equates mankind to the Earth that "falling in love" gently wraps around with the falling rays of the sun. Like in many of her other poems, Harjo emphasizes
                        the human connection with the Earth. But I think the key detail here is that the way the speaker is using the past tense. We used to be the Earth. We used to yearn for
                        touch, but all that has been lost with time. Moving the "us up" down to these lines insted of finishing the sentence in the previous section forces the reader to pause
                        and really notice that Harjo was intentional about the effect being on us.
                    </p>
                    <p class="annotation" id="a5">
                        5. Like in several of her other poems, Harjo makes a reference to the stars. In Mvskoke Creek culture and folklore, the stars are seen as spiritual symbols, often
                        representative of ancestors. In these lines, Harjo seems to mean that each thought had some connection to ancient tradition or with the ancestors in mind. Of course,
                        only before there was "No way back."
                    </p>
                    <p class="annotation" id="a6">
                        6. No way back, Miss Mary Mack. This is an interesting blend of traditional ancient folklore and the stuff that she (and most of her audience) probably grew up with as 
                        kids. The rhyme "Miss Mary Mack" is often interpreted as the whimsical story of a girl who actively grows up, in a strange way gaining independence from her parents and 
                        perhaps jumping over the fence with the elephants that seem to represent a larger state of being. Harjo uses this to build these lines that seem to say we've moved into 
                        a point of no return. In the modern day, we've jumped over the fence, and we've stopped planting thoughts the way they used to, and we may never be able to again.
                    </p>
                    <p class="annotation" id="a7">
                        7. Harjo writes about babies and familial possession and the plants all in the same breath. The plants are family. She brings up their stories, and it has the effect of showing 
                        us their relationship with the wildlife in a much more intimate way than just saying they could communicate with the plants. This is an important building factor that 
                        explains why she feels such strong attachment to the tobacco plant and why its loss affects her acutely. To a people whose plants are their babies, its like ripping the baby 
                        from their arms and selling it.
                    </p>
                    <p class="annotation" id="a8">
                        8. The first word in this line is "Were." It's a little odd that she places that much emphasis on the word when she corrects it later in the poem anyway. But in the very 
                        next line, she starts it with "Should," and that feels like she's saying that even though she should, she won't because the essence of these songs has been lost, maybe 
                        even stolen.
                    </p>
                    <p class="annotation" id="a9">
                        9. Harjo emphasizes this elusive "forever now." She's saying that this link can never be broken. As long as time passes, the past will always be connected to the present with
                        this link. Then the story of the creation of the tobacco plant really begins. And it starts with Mvskoke people. "The shimmer of early evening" draws a very intimate and
                        serene image.
                    </p>
                    <p class="annotation" id="a10">
                        10. These lines stand primarily to depict the love between these two individuals. The birthing of tobacco was not a faceless emotionless event. It was born of gentle,
                        teasing, and tender love. And like everything else in this poem, "gut love" is an incredibly rich and raw phrase. To love with all your gut is to love from the deepest, 
                        most vulnerable part of your soul.
                    </p>
                    <p class="annotation" id="a11">
                        11. It almost feels too intimate to be reading. Harjo builds this moment to equate the planting of the seed as the conceiving of the baby. The tobacco plant is as her
                        ancestor and her sister. The way she integrated the bed and the night time really makes it seem like the plant was conceived the same way a human baby is, but the details 
                        that follow make that distinction much more clear.

                        12. The symbolism of the parents walking towards the sunrise is worth exploring. They walk towards a new horizon, potentially towards the end of their own time and the birth
                        of a new generation. Yet they look back towards the tobacco plant to see it fighting for life and thriving. That is the their blood's work. That is the proliferation of
                        their being. That is their new start.

                        13. And finally the tobacco plant grows. The flower opens its petals to the gentle loving of the light and the roots draw up the gentle loving of the Earth. The Earth is the
                        people. Nowadays, with the way it's been commercialized, tobacco is mostly known as the powder wrapped in a cigarette. Harjo depicts its flower. And it is the result of
                        the man and the woman with the leafy beautiful stalk and the white flower, white like a blank canvas.

                        14. While I couldn't find a direct translation for "Hece," I know its a Mvskoke word, since at the end of the poem, its paired with "Mvto." While the language and the name is
                        infinitely important, the focus of these lines was elsewhere. All these lines come together to show the deep relationship between the tobacco plant and the Mvskoke. It's a bond
                        that crosses generations. They see themselves as the guardians of the tobacco, the ones nurturing their loved one's beloved in their absence. It goes back to the first few lines
                        where Harjo talked about the thoughts that were planted and grew all the way to the stars. Their actions were taken with their ancestors constantly in the forefront of their
                        minds. The love and the connection and the generational bridges in these lines add a layer of emotional complexity to the poem.

                        15. It's very intentional that Harjo mentions being able to hear the plants before she mentions being able to sing back to them. In the first place, the lines before these had hinted
                        that the people from back then had offered themselves in service to the plant. Naturally, the listening comes before the speech. It puzzles me a little why she includes the "like
                        now" here instead of on the next line. Her explicit mentioning of "way back" makes it clear that it is not like now. I suppose that has the effect of making the reader furrow
                        their brow and look again at the words and work to hear the meaning.

                        16. This is definitely my favorite set of lines in the poem. One of my favorite things about <i>An American Sunrise</i> is that its message is so intimately interwoven with the
                        resistance. Harjo does not write to entertain. Harjo does not write to settle. She writes to provoke, she writes to change, she writes to rewrite. And all of that is so
                        beautifully embodied in this poem where she defends the tobacco stolen from her people and exploited for its addictiveness. Tobacco is not criminal. It is love and
                        heritage made criminal by the man with money. She starts these lines continuing the sentence fragment, comparing singing to writing. It expresses her frustration at
                        being able to sing back, but not being able to listen. But she mentions that our ears are wrapped around earbuds. They are not gone, they are occupied by the moneymen.
                        They, like the tobacco, have been stolen. But still, they are not gone. The resistance, suppressed, lives.

                        17. Now it seems to be the tobacco plant speaking, inviting the narrator (perhaps Harjo, herself) to sing back. This seems to be a turning point where the narrator can
                        finally hear the song of the tobacco plant. And now, the Miss Mary Mack allusion comes back, but this time it is dressed around the tobacco plant. Silver buttons, perhaps
                        symbolizing maturity, now adorn the plant, fastened to the dress with the light of the moon. From the sun rise to the high of the moon, the tobacco plant has grown and
                        matured. Now, like its mother and father, the sunrise awaits on the other side of the moon light.

                        18. The ending starts at these lines. It feels like a cascade and a relooping of the story. We assume the moon has fallen and the tobacco plant has left into the sun rise 
                        with its ancestors. The song of life and origin will play itself in a new mound of earth as the people prepare. The last part we are meant to understand tells us the sun is 
                        dimming faster. It seems ominous, like it could mean there is less and less time for the plants and the people to grow or that the stories following this one will begin to taper,
                        but it could also mean that the resistance is picking up. That the stories are growing faster and faster and that the people can hear again.

                        19. I love this detail. The language is so important to the poem because the origin story of the Mvskoke tobacco is not meant to be delivered in only English. According to
                        a quick Google search, the first line is composed of three variations of gratitude-expession. I could not find what "Kanvchaga" meant. "Mvcho" again means "thank you." Harjo leaves
                        it up to the reader to determine who is being thanked. I like to imagine its the ancestors that she wrote about much earlier. That right now, the narrator is planting the seeds
                        and as it was done before, the seeds are being planted with the eye trained on the ancestors, with the wishes that the seeds will grow to the stars.
