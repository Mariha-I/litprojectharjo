        <h1>Poetry</h1>
        <p>Harjo's poetry is ladden with vivid nature imagery, influenced by her Mvskogee Creek heritage. In many of her poems, subtle references to Mvskogee folklore make an appearance,
            adding to the rich discussion on love, trauma, growth, resistance, and spirituality. Harjo's personal experiences trickle into her writing, and her poems tend to be very open
             and raw and vulnerable. 
        </p>
        <p>
             Her writing is incredibly intentional. My favorite example of this is her poem "Becoming Seventy," in which she crafts exactly 70 stanzas with each 
             stanza steadily growing longer. Her poems typically do not fit a particular rhyme scheme or structure. However, the structure of each poem is very carefully constructed
             in cooperation with its message. In her poem titled "Insomnia and the Seven Steps to Grace," the stanzas follow an alternating pattern. One is long, the next is short, the 
             next is long again. The structure mimics the lull of a sleep-deprived mind. On the other hand, "Invisible Fish" is written all in one stanza with short, punctuated sentences,
             mostly void of description until the very last sentence. The poem itself is about the cyclical nature of the destruction and the way we change the Earth and ourselves for 
             our benefit eventually means the world leaves us and our past behind. The poem's shortness and dry descriptions of "earlier" events reinforces the fleeting, forgetable nature
             of the past. The long, descriptive sentence at the end punctuates how much has changed and how little people have noticed.
        </p>
        <p> Though Harjo's poetry is filled with references to nature, her poems mostly center around the human experience. This means that most of her poems end up exploring the 
            deep connection between humans and the nature around them. In many of the poems, the Earth functions as a sentient character whom the narrator often interacts with. 
            A particularly strong theme across her writing is the raw, unadulterated view on the Indigenous experience. Her 
            poems in and of themselves are a form of resistance and preservation of Mvskogee history. As a poet and an activist, she speaks not only for the Mvskogee Nation, but for 
            Indigenous peoples all over the country.

        <h1>Poem Analysis</h1>
        <p class="poemtext">It was way back, before there was a way back<br>
            When time threaded earth and sky.<br>
            Children were conceived, were born, grew, and walked tall<br>
            In what we now call a day.<br>
            There must have been two suns, a bright moon, somehow<br>
            We had more light than now, sheen<br>
            Of falling in love playing about Earth’s body<br>
            In a wild flicker which lit<br>
            Us up. We who were this planet and yearned for touch.<br>
            Every planted thought grew plant<br>
            Ladders to the stars, way back, before there was<br>
            No way back, Miss Mary Mack.<br>
            We used to sing along the buttons of her<br>
            Dress. Our babies are always<br>
            Our babies. Even back then when time waved through<br>
            The corn. We knew our plants like<br>
            Relatives. Their stories were our stories, there<br>
            Were songs for everything — I<br>
            Should say “are” songs for every transformation<br>
            They link between way back and<br>
            Now, the forever now, a time when a young<br>
            Mvskoke man and woman<br>
            Walked through the shimmer of the early evening.<br>
            They had become as one song.<br>
            They lay down when it was dark. I can hear their<br>
            Intimate low-voice talking.<br>
            How they tease one another with such gut love.<br>
            Earth makes a bed, with pillow<br>
            Mounds. And it is there as the night insects sing<br>
            They conceived their first child. They<br>
            Will look back as they walk East toward the sunrise.<br>
            The raw stalks of beginning<br>
            Will drink the light, root deeply dark into earth.<br>
            In the tracks of their loving<br>
            The plant-child emerges, first the seed head, then<br>
            Leafy, long male body and the white female<br>
            Flowers of tobacco, or<br>
            Hece, as the people called it when it called<br>
            To them. Come here. We were brought<br>
            To you from those who love you. We will help you.<br>
            And that’s how it began, way<br>
            Back, when we knew how to hear the songs of plants<br>
            And could sing back, like now<br>
            On paper, with marks like bird feet, but where are<br>
            Our ears? They have grown to fit<br>
            Around earbuds, to hear music made for cold<br>
            Cash, like our beloved smoke-<br>
            Making threaded with addiction and dead words.<br>
            Sing this song back to me, girl.<br>
            In the moonlight, tobacco plant had silver<br>
            Moon buttons all up her back.<br>
            We’re getting dressed to go plant new songs with words.<br>
            Our sun is dimming faster.<br>
            Mvto hece, mvto hvse, mvto e — <br>
            Kanvchaga, mvto ah
